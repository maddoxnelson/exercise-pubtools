# Publishing Tools Technical Exercise Interview

## Getting started

In this exercise, you'll fetch a list of news stories and apply various filters to them, simulating a real-world workflow our newsroom uses to find and edit stories.

First, run the following steps:
1. Clone the repo:  
   `git clone https://github.com/WPMedia/pubtools-interview-exercise.git`
1. Run `npm install` from the root directory.
1. Run `npm run start` to spin up the project. You should see a mostly blank screen at `localhost:3000`.

Open up the `src/App.js` file for further instructions.
