# Publishing Tools Technical Exercise Interview

## Getting started

In this exercise, you'll fetch a list of news stories and apply various filters to them, simulating a real-world workflow our newsroom uses to find and edit stories.

## Pre-requisites:
- Make sure you have Node installed. Most versions should be fine, but if you run into any issues, we've tested it on `v13.13.0`.
  - It can help to have [NVM installed](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to switch between versions, if you run into issues.

## Getting started:
1. Clone the repo:  
   `git clone git@github.com:maddoxnelson/exercise.git`
1. `cd exercise`
1. Run `npm install` from the root directory.
1. Run `npm run start` to spin up the project. You should see a mostly blank screen at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

Open up the `src/App.js` file for further instructions.
