Feel free to pick any or all of these goals, in any particular order.

- Add a dropdown allowing users to filter stories by section
- Look at the data coming back from the API, and modify the StoryCard UI to make the cards more useful to a user.
- Refactor to use the React Context API (or something like it) instead of prop drilling.
- Write tests in `App.test.js` for the items you've made.
